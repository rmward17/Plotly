# Belly Button Bacteria Diversity

For this project, we were tasked with creating an interactive dashboard that would should information on different bacateria samples. The purpose of the dashboard is to allow the volunteers to view the bacteria from their samples.

This was fun and exciting to create and luckily, we are able to deploy the dahsboard using github pages.
